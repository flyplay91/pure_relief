                            Cannabidiol, or CBD, is an organic compound found in the hemp plant. It belongs to a family of similar compounds known as cannabinoids.

                    <p class="align-left">The endocannabinoid system, or ECS, is a network of receptors, endocannabinoids, and enzymes that is integral to human and animal health. The ECS uses cannabinoid signaling compounds, like <a href="https://www.purerelief.com/cbd-oils/">CBD oil products</a>, that interact with receptors to help regulate functions like sleep, inflammation, and anxiety. By regulating these vital functions, the ECS is continuously helping to maintain homeostasis which is the equilibrium between all systems in the body.

                                The endocannabinoid system is integral to human and animal health. This system, also known as the ECS, has receptors located throughout the immune system and nervous system. Receptors are activated by internal cannabinoids produced by our system (endocannabinoids) or external cannabinoids like CBD.

        <div class="text-align-center">
            <p>The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp in the United States at the federal level. The bill established norms and regulations for the benefit of the hemp industry, including removing hemp from the federal list of controlled substances and taking away the DEA’s power to treat hemp as an illicit drug. Industrial hemp is now classified as an agricultural commodity regulated by the Department of Agriculture as well as individual state agencies. As a result, CBD derived from industrial hemp is legal nationwide.</p>

                <h3>Will CBD Get Me High?</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether or not CBD will show up on a drug test is one of the most common questions regarding CBD. While CBD does not produce a “high” effect, people who have heard about CBD are often hesitant to try it due to its erroneous association with drugs like marijuana.

                <h3>Hemp, Marijuana, and Cannabis: What’s the Difference?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hemp and marijuana are two different varieties of the cannabis plant. Marijuana is rich in THC which is the compound responsible for producing psychoactive effects. On the other hand, hemp is rich in CBD and has non-detectable levels of THC, which is why hemp is often used for industrial purposes.

        <div class="drutest-faqs-item">
                <h3>CBD and Drug Tests</h3>
                <p>Drug tests show the presence of recreational drug residues in our systems that indicate recent use. For example, they test for certain elements in marijuana and cocaine, not necessarily the drug itself. This is why drug tests check for THC, the mind-altering compound found in marijuana. Because CBD is legal and does not elicit a high, drug tests do not check for CBD.

        <div class="drutest-faqs-item text-align-right">
            <h3>Is CBD Safe?</h3>
            <p>Not only will CBD not get you high, but it won’t cause any harmful side effects either. Some users have experienced mild drowsiness with large doses of CBD, but this is not common. Most importantly, CBD is entirely non-addictive and non-habit-forming, making it a safer alternative than conventional medications.
