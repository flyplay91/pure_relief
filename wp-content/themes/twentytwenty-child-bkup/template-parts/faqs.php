                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>CBD is short for cannabidiol, one of the two major cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. It is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid found within the hemp plant. Because CBD is non-psychotropic, its properties are purely medicinal. Pure Relief CBD is extracted from industrial hemp using supercritical CO2 extraction to deliver broad-spectrum CBD.&nbsp;<a href="/what-is-cbd/"><strong>Read more…</strong></a></p>

                        <button class="accordion">  Is CBD Legal, and Can I Buy It Where I Live?</button>
                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp in the United States at the federal level. The bill established norms and regulation for the benefit of the hemp industry including removing hemp from the federal list of controlled substances and taking away the DEA’s power to treat hemp as an illicit drug. Industrial hemp is now classified as an agricultural commodity and is regulated by the Department of Agriculture and individual state agencies. As a result, CBD derived from industrial hemp is legal nationwide.</p>

                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>No, here at Pure Relief we are proud that our products contain less than .3% THC, the legal limite, along with third-party lab tested to prove so. Through our carbon processing system in our ISO 7 clean lab, we extract all possible traces of THC before creating all of our products. Since THC is the psychotropic compound in cannabis, our products will not deliver that psychotropic effect.</p>

                        <button class="accordion"> So It Won’t Get Me High, but Will I Pass a Drug Test?</button>
                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>It is a common occurrence for many workplaces to run a drug screening on employees and one of the biggest concerns is whether CBD will affect their results. Not to worry, most workplaces running drug tests are screening specifically for Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC for short, the leasing psychotropic ingredient in the cannabis plant. Since our products are entirely THC-free, you should not worry.</p>

                            <p>However, if you are in fact subjected to any form of drug testing, we at the Pure Relief family suggest speaking with your healthcare provider, employer, or drug test/screening center.</p>

                        <button class="accordion"> What is the Difference Between CBD and the Other Famous Cannabinoid THC?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Although the two cannabinoids have a very similar structure, the two are most definitely different! CBD and THC are the most popular cannabinoids in cannabis due to their therapeutic properties. However, where THC provides a psychotropic “high” feeling, CBD is a non-psychotropic cannabinoid meaning its properties are solely medicinal.</p>

                        <button class="accordion"> What is the Endocannabinoid System (ECS)?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>The Endocannabinoid System, or ECS for short, is a collection of cell receptors found within mammals. This receptor system exists in the immune system, central nervous system, and in many organs. The primary function of the ECS is to support homeostasis, or the body’s ability to maintain internal balance. The ECS has been shown to support many of the body’s biological tasks including energy and balance, immune function, sleep, memory, metabolism, and the function of the autonomic nervous system.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>CBD interacts directly with the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS). By interacting with these receptors, CBD has been shown to help with inflammation, anxiety, stress, and a multitude of other conditions.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>In contrast to many FDA approved medications that carry dangerous side-effects, the side effects of CBD are almost non-existent. In some instances when a large amount of CBD is consumed, there have been reports of some stomach discomfort. Large doses of CBD may also have a mild sedative effect.
                            </p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>There have been no reported cases of overdosing on CBD. Although CBD can cause a change in mood or anxiety, an overdose has yet to be reported.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Because our CBD products are derived from the hemp plant and not marijuana, you do not need a medical card or prescription.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>This question varies from user to user, and ultimately it comes down to what exactly the user is trying to accomplish. For some users, a small amount of CBD will suffice; however, other users may need to resort to a higher dosage in order to achieve the same results. If you are new to CBD, it is recommended you start with small doses and work your way up gradually.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>It typically takes around 15-60 minutes for the effects of CBD to be felt. Certain products like CBD oil and CBD rolls act faster due to their delivery method which allows CBD to be absorbed into the bloodstream at a relatively fast rate. Edibles and CBD capsules usually take longer to kick in since they need to pass through the digestive system first.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>There is a large body of research on the effects of CBD. However, we are not doctors, nor do we claim to be, and therefore cannot diagnose, treat, or prescribe our products for any disease. Here at Pure Relief, we believe in the power of education, so we highly encourage you to do some research on your own.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Discovered in 1998 by two Israeli scientists, the entourage effect describes their findings. The findings suggest that taking the entire spectrum of natural cannabinoids found in cannabis is more beneficial than taking a single compound.
